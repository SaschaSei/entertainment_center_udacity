# Entertainment Center
This is a simple program that shows some of my favourite films and links to
their corresponding trailers. The code was mostly achieved during the Python
starter course on Udacity.


## Requirements

This was coded in **Python 2.7.13** so you have to have at this version of
Python installed. You can dowload this verson of Python
[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How To Run The Program
Simply double click the **entertainment_center.py** file.

## Contributions
This program uses fresh_tomatoes.py originally from Udacity.
