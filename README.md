# Entertainment Center
This is a simple program that shows some of my favourite films and links to
their corresponding trailers. The code was mostly achieved during the Python
starter course on Udacity.


## Requirements

This was coded in **Python 2.7.13** so you have to have at this version of
Python installed. You can dowload this verson of Python
[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How To Download And Run The Program
* download the latest repository from [here](https://github.com/SaschaSei/entertainment_center_udacity/archive/master.zip)
* extract the zip file into a folder
* run the **entertainment_center.py**

## Contributions
This program uses fresh_tomatoes.py originally from Udacity.
